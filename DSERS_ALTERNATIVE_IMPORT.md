# DSers Product Import - Alternative Methods

Since DSers doesn't have a direct CSV export button, here are several ways to get your products:

## Method 1: Export via Shopify/WooCommerce (Recommended)

If you're using DSers with Shopify or WooCommerce:

### For Shopify:
1. Log in to your Shopify admin
2. Go to **Products** → **All products**
3. Click **Export** (top right)
4. Choose "All products" and CSV format
5. Click **Export products**
6. Upload the CSV to: http://localhost:3001/dsers-import-csv

### For WooCommerce:
1. Log in to WordPress admin
2. Go to **Products** → **All Products**
3. Click **Export** at the top
4. Choose CSV format
5. Click **Generate CSV**
6. Upload the CSV to: http://localhost:3001/dsers-import-csv

## Method 2: Manual Product Entry (Web Interface)

I can create a simple form where you can manually add products one by one.

## Method 3: Copy-Paste from DSers

1. Open DSers and go to your product list
2. Copy the product information
3. Use a simple form to paste and create products

## Method 4: Use Existing Sample Data

The 10 sample products I already imported are ready to use. You can:
- Modify them through the database
- Use them as templates
- Start selling with these products
