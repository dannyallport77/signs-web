## Response to Guideline 2.1 - Business Model Information

### 1. Who are the users that will use the paid services in the app?

**User Types:**
- **Franchise Partners:** Business owners who purchase territorial franchise rights to sell NFC review collection signs
- **Resellers:** Smaller partners who resell signs without exclusive territory
- **End Customers:** Businesses (restaurants, shops, service providers) who purchase NFC signs

**Primary App Users:** Franchise partners and resellers who use the app to program NFC tags for their customers.

### 2. Where can users purchase the services that can be accessed in the app?

**Purchase Channels:**
- **Website:** https://www.review-signs.co.uk/franchise (franchise applications)
- **Direct Contact:** Users contact us via email (franchise@review-signs.co.uk) or phone
- **Physical Products:** NFC signs are purchased through our web dashboard after franchise approval

**Important:** The iOS app itself does NOT sell any products or services. It is a utility tool for users who have ALREADY purchased franchise rights and physical NFC signs through our website.

### 3. What specific types of previously purchased services can a user access in the app?

Users who have purchased franchise rights can access:
- **NFC Tag Programming:** Write Google review links to NFC tags embedded in physical signs
- **Business Search:** Find nearby businesses using Google Maps API
- **Tag Inventory Management:** Track which tags have been programmed for which customers

**No In-App Purchases:** All services are included with the franchise purchase made externally.

### 4. What paid content, subscriptions, or features are unlocked within your app that do not use in-app purchase?

**Access is based on franchise purchase (made outside the app):**
- Full access to NFC tag programming
- Business search and mapping features
- Customer management tools

**Why no IAP required:**
- This is a B2B productivity tool, not a consumer app
- Revenue comes from franchise fees and physical product sales (NFC signs), not digital services
- Similar to apps like Square Point of Sale or Shopify - they're tools for business owners who pay separately for the business service
- Per App Store Review Guidelines 3.1.3(b), this app is exempt from IAP requirements as it provides physical goods/services purchased elsewhere

### 5. How do users obtain an account? Do users have to pay a fee to create an account?

**Account Creation Process:**
1. User applies for franchise via website: https://www.review-signs.co.uk/franchise
2. We review the application (business verification)
3. User pays franchise fee (£5,000-£50,000 depending on territory size) via bank transfer/invoice
4. We create their account credentials manually and email them
5. User logs into the mobile app with provided credentials

**No Self-Service Registration:** Users cannot create accounts through the app itself. All accounts are created by our admin team after franchise purchase.

**Fee Structure:**
- Franchise fee (one-time): £5,000 - £50,000
- Reseller fee (one-time): £5,000 - £15,000
- Monthly subscription: None
- Per-transaction fees: None

## Response to Guideline 2.3.8 - App Icons (Placeholder)

We acknowledge the current app icon appears to be a placeholder.

**Action Taken:**

- The icon will feature NFC-related imagery (e.g., NFC symbol with a review star or business sign)
- All icon sizes (1024x1024, and all required iOS sizes) will be consistent
- Icon will clearly represent the app's purpose

**Timeline:** New app icons will be designed and uploaded within 24 hours.

## Summary

Our app is a specialized B2B tool for franchise partners who sell physical NFC review collection signs. The app's sole purpose is to program NFC tags embedded in these physical products. All revenue is generated from franchise fees and physical product sales conducted outside the app ecosystem, making it exempt from IAP requirements per guideline 3.1.3(b).

We will address all metadata issues (screenshots, icons, demo video) within 24-48 hours and update this submission accordingly.

Thank you for your thorough review.
